# Cook-DSA

Welcome to my DSA practice repository! This repo contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I solve while learning and improving my coding skills. 

## Purpose

This repository is a record of my journey through DSA problems. It helps me track my progress, revise concepts, and build a strong problem-solving foundation. Solutions are categorized by topics for easy navigation.

## Repo Organization

- **Arrays/** - Solutions related to array problems
- **LinkedLists/** - Solutions for linked list challenges
- **Trees/** - Tree data structure questions
- **Graphs/** - Graph algorithms and problems
- **DynamicProgramming/** - Problems using DP techniques
- **SortingSearching/** - Sorting and searching algorithms
- **Others/** - Miscellaneous problems not fitting other categories

Each folder contains code files named meaningfully with comments explaining the approach used.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for your learning. If you find any errors or have suggestions, pull requests and issues are welcome!

## Disclaimer

The name of the repo expresses my personal sentiment towards DSA practice. The content is serious and aimed at continuous learning and improvement.
